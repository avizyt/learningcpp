# Explanation of Comparator function in CPP
### **Struct Definition**

```cpp
struct Edge {
    int u, v, weight;
    bool operator<(const Edge &other) const {
        return weight < other.weight;
    }
};
```

#### **Components of the `Edge` Struct**

1. **`int u`**: 
   - Represents one endpoint of the edge (a node in the graph).

2. **`int v`**: 
   - Represents the other endpoint of the edge.

3. **`int weight`**:
   - Represents the weight or cost associated with this edge. This is typically used in graph algorithms like Minimum Spanning Tree (MST).

4. **`bool operator<(const Edge &other) const`**:
   - This is a custom comparator (overloaded `<` operator). 
   - It allows edges to be compared based on their weights, so they can be sorted in ascending order.
   - **Usage**: When you use a sorting function (like `std::sort`), it will arrange the edges by their weights.

### **How the Comparator Works**

The comparator function:

```cpp
bool operator<(const Edge &other) const {
    return weight < other.weight;
}
```

- Takes another `Edge` object (`other`) as input.
- Compares the **current edge's weight** with the **other edge's weight**.
- Returns:
  - `true` if the current edge's weight is smaller (to maintain ascending order).
  - `false` otherwise.

#### **Why Overload `<` Operator?**

In graph algorithms like Kruskal's Algorithm, we need to process edges in increasing order of their weights. By overloading the `<` operator, we can easily use functions like `std::sort` to arrange edges:

```cpp
std::vector<Edge> edges;
// Add edges to the vector...
std::sort(edges.begin(), edges.end());
```

The `std::sort` function uses the `<` operator to compare edges and will arrange them by their weights in ascending order.

### **Example Usage**

#### **Input Graph**
Suppose we have the following edges:
- \( (1, 2, 3) \) → Edge between nodes 1 and 2 with weight 3.
- \( (1, 3, 1) \) → Edge between nodes 1 and 3 with weight 1.
- \( (2, 3, 2) \) → Edge between nodes 2 and 3 with weight 2.

#### **Code**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

struct Edge {
    int u, v, weight;
    bool operator<(const Edge &other) const {
        return weight < other.weight;
    }
};

int main() {
    std::vector<Edge> edges = {
        {1, 2, 3},
        {1, 3, 1},
        {2, 3, 2}
    };

    std::sort(edges.begin(), edges.end());

    for (const Edge &edge : edges) {
        std::cout << "Edge: (" << edge.u << ", " << edge.v << "), Weight: " << edge.weight << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

#### **Output**
After sorting by weight, the edges are:

```
Edge: (1, 3), Weight: 1
Edge: (2, 3), Weight: 2
Edge: (1, 2), Weight: 3
```

### **Benefits of the `Edge` Struct**
1. **Encapsulation**: Groups related data (`u`, `v`, `weight`) in a single structure.
2. **Ease of Sorting**: Custom comparator allows simple and efficient sorting of edges.
3. **Readable Code**: Makes the representation and manipulation of graph edges more intuitive.

--- 

### **Conclusion**
The `Edge` struct is fundamental for graph-related algorithms. Its custom `<` operator is crucial for sorting edges by weight, which is essential for algorithms like **Kruskal's MST**, **Prim's MST**, or even shortest-path algorithms when sorting edges is required.
