Sure, here are five story-based interview questions for each of the topics: Stack, Queue, Graph, and Tree.

### Stack:
1. **Pit Stop Strategy:**
   In a Formula 1 race, each team has to decide their pit stop strategy wisely to win. Given a sequence of lap times and the time it takes to make a pit stop, write a program to find the minimum time it takes for a car to complete the race, assuming it can make a pit stop at any lap.

2. **Balanced Parentheses:**
   During a rally race, the drivers use a communication system with parentheses to indicate turns. The co-driver sends instructions using parentheses, but sometimes they forget to close them properly. Write a program to check if the parentheses in the instruction string are balanced.

3. **Function Call Stack:**
   In a simulated race track, there are multiple check points. Each time a car passes a check point, a function call is made to update the position. Implement a stack-based approach to simulate the function call stack and track the order of check points passed by the cars.

4. **Undo Functionality:**
   In a remote-controlled car race, the players can make moves, but they also have an undo option. Implement a stack-based approach to store the moves made by the car, allowing players to undo the last move.

5. **Expression Evaluation:**
   During a high-speed chase, the police need to evaluate the speed of the suspect's car using radar data. Write a program to evaluate postfix expressions representing radar data using a stack-based approach.

### Queue:
1. **Queue at the Pit Stop:**
   At a Formula 1 pit stop, cars queue up to get serviced. Implement a queue-based system to manage the cars waiting for their turn at the pit stop.

2. **Traffic Jam Escape:**
   In a city with heavy traffic, cars are trying to escape the jam by taking alternative routes. Implement a queue-based approach to find the shortest route for a car to exit the traffic jam.

3. **Round-Robin Scheduling:**
   In a racing competition, there are multiple teams with drivers waiting for their turn to compete. Implement a queue-based round-robin scheduling system to ensure fair competition among the teams.

4. **Breadth-First Search in a Maze:**
   Imagine a maze where a car needs to find the shortest path to the exit. Implement a breadth-first search algorithm using a queue-based approach to find the shortest path for the car to reach the exit.

5. **Customer Service Call Center:**
   In a car rental company, customers call to book cars. Implement a queue-based approach to manage the incoming calls and serve them based on their arrival time.

### Graph:
1. **Race Track Navigation:**
   Design a graph-based system to represent a race track with checkpoints as nodes and the distance between them as edges. Implement Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path for a car to complete the race.

2. **Overtaking Strategy:**
   In a Formula 1 race, drivers need to plan their overtaking strategy carefully. Implement a graph-based approach to find the maximum number of overtakes a driver can make given the positions of other cars on the track.

3. **Fuel Efficiency Optimization:**
   During a rally race, cars need to optimize fuel consumption to finish the race. Implement a graph-based approach to find the most fuel-efficient path from start to finish.

4. **Track Maintenance Plan:**
   In a racing circuit, the track needs maintenance at certain points. Implement a graph-based approach to plan the maintenance schedule, ensuring that the race is not affected.

5. **Race Strategy Simulation:**
   Create a graph-based simulation to model different race strategies, such as pitting early vs. late, and evaluate their impact on the overall race time.

### Tree:
1. **Leaderboard Ranking:**
   In a racing competition, participants are ranked based on their lap times. Implement a binary search tree to maintain the leaderboard, allowing insertion of new lap times and efficient retrieval of top performers.

2. **Pit Crew Hierarchy:**
   In a Formula 1 team, there is a hierarchy among the pit crew members. Implement a binary tree to represent the hierarchy, allowing efficient retrieval of crew members based on their roles.

3. **Race Strategy Decision:**
   Design a decision tree to help teams make race strategy decisions based on factors like weather conditions, tire wear, and track layout.

4. **Driver Performance Analysis:**
   Create a binary search tree to analyze the performance of drivers based on their lap times, allowing efficient retrieval of statistical data such as average lap time and fastest lap.

5. **Track Layout Representation:**
   Design a tree structure to represent the layout of a race track, with nodes representing turns and edges representing straight sections. Implement traversal algorithms to analyze the track layout and suggest improvements.
